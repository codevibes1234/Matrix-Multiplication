# In the program threaded_matrix_mul.c, the matrices have been multiplied by multithreading.
# In the program matrix_multiplication.c, the matrices have been multiplied normally without using multithreading.
# prof_threaded_mul contains information about execution time of the code threaded_matrix_mul.c.
# prof_normal_mul contains information about execution time of the code matrix_multiplication.c.
# Both the codes have been tested for N = 800. The order of execution time remains the same for any N, i.e the matrix multiplication done without using multithreading always runs faster and the gap only grows with N.
